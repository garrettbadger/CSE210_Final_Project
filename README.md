# Asteroids
Do you love classic arcade games? Then you'll want to try out my take on Asteroids. This is a take on the classic Asteroids arcade game that I built for a school project. 


## Getting Started
---
Make sure you have Python 3.8.0 or newer and raylib-py.
```
py -m pip install raylib-py
```
After you've installed the required libraries, open a terminal and browse to the 
project's root folder. Start the program by running the following command.
```
py asteroids game main.py
```
You can also run the program from an IDE like Visual Studio Code. Start your IDE 
and open the project folder. Select the main module inside the hunter folder and 
click the "run" icon.

## Project Structure
---
The project files and folders are organized as follows:
```
root                    (project root folder)
+-- asteroid             (source code for game)
  +-- game              (specific game classes)
  +-- __init__.py       (python package file)
  +-- __main__.py       (entry point for program)
+-- README.md           (general info)
```
